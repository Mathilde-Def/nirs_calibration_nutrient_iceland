# 01_prediction_model

This folder contains a ready-to-use prediction model for estimating C, N, and P in herbivore faecal samples using NIRS spectral data.

## Overview

- `Prediction_script.R`: Main script to apply the prediction models to new spectral data.
- `nirs_faecal_C_model2024.rda`: Final multispecies model to predict carbon (% dry weight).
- `nirs_faecal_N_model2024.rda`: Final multispecies model to predict nitrogen (% dry weight).
- `nirs_faecal_P_model2024.rda`: Final multispecies model to predict phosphorus (% dry weight).
