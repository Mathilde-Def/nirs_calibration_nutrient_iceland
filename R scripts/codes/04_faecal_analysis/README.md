# 04_faecal_analysis

This folder contains R scripts used to perform the statistical analysis of the faecal nutrient data. They assess the variation in faecal nutrient content (C, N, P) and stoichiometric ratio (C:N, C:P and N:P) by herbivore species (goose, sheep, reindeer) and throughout the growing season (beginning, peak, end). Additionally, they estimate the total nutrient deposition (N, P and C) by herbivores over the growing season.

## Overview

- `faecal_nutrient_content.R`: Script to perform statistical analysis (Two-ways ANOVA and parwise comparision) on the faecal nutrient data.
- `faecal_deposition.R`: Script to estimate total nutrient deposition for each species across the growing season.
