Data file description:
Here we provide the necessary data and scripts to perform the calibrations for measuring faecal nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon content using near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy presented in Defourneaux et al. (in press): Capturing seasonal variations in faecal nutrient content from tundra herbivores using Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy.
We provide the models and scripts which can be used to predict faecal N, P and C content from spectral data obtained by near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy. 

Data file structure:
There are seperate folders for N, P and C data, scripts and models and each of these folders contains 2 subfolders:

A ready-to-apply script to measure N, P or C in faecal samples: These folders contain the script and the model to predict faecal N, P or C content from spectral data as well as a test-dataset and a ReadMe-file with futher information.

Dataset and procedure to develop a predictive model for N, P or C:  These folders contain the script and the dataset used to perform the calibrations for measuring foliar nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon content using near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy as well as a sample-description file and a ReadMe-file with further information.
