Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy calibration models for faecal nutrient content from Icelandic tundra herbivores
Models were based on faecal samples from three different common tundra species: the sheep (Ovis aries), the Pink-footed goose (Anser Brachyrynchus) and the reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). Samples were collected in Eastern Highlands, Iceland.
